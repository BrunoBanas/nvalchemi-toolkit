Monte Carlo (nvalchemi.mc)
==========================

Batched, GPU-resident Monte Carlo samplers. Each step proposes one move per
active graph, evaluates the trial energies in one model call, and accepts or
restores every graph independently. Samplers are
:class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.BaseDynamics` engines, so they take the same
hooks, run inside a :class:`~nvalchemi.dynamics.base.FusedStage`, and keep
``atomic_masses`` in step with the species. For usage and the UMA settings
that make them fast, see the :ref:`dynamics user guide <dynamics_simulations_guide>`.
